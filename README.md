# SchemaOnRead
The [SchemaOnRead](http://drmichaelnorth.github.io/SchemaOnRead/ "SchemaOnRead Home Page") R package on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SchemaOnRead/index.html "SchemaOnRead CRAN Web Page") provides schema-on-read tools including a single function call (e.g., schemaOnRead("filename")) that reads text (TXT), comma separated value (CSV), raster image (BMP, PNG, GIF, TIFF, and JPG), R data (RDS), HDF5, NetCDF, spreadsheet (XLS, XLSX, ODS, and DIF), Weka Attribute-Relation File Format (ARFF), Epi Info (REC), SPSS (SAV), Systat (SYS), and Stata (DTA) files. It also recursively reads folders (e.g., schemaOnRead("folder")), returning a nested list of the contained elements.
